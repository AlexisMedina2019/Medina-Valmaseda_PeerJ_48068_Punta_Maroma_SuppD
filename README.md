Figure 1 of manuscript represent the Ecological seascape and zonation of the fringing reef at Punta Maroma. (A) Location of Punta
Maroma; (B) Reef zonation and geomorphology showing: slope breaks and geomorphological zones
(following Blanchon et al., 2017) and ecological seascape zones (following Jordan-Dahlgren et al., 1981 ´
and Estrada-Sald´ıvar et al., 2019); (C) View of the Reef-Front zone (or Fore reef) at 5 m; (D) View of the
Rock-Terrace zone (or Fore reef) at 10 m; (E) View of the Mid-shelf break (or Fore reef) between 10 to

Fidure 2 of manuscript is a Box Plots of A. Coral colony densities in 2019 and B. Live coral coverage before the 1990s,
by accretion-functional groups, coral morphology and geomorphic zone in two reef zones at Punta
Maroma reef. The bottom and top of the box are the first and third quartiles, respectively, the black line
inside the box is the median. Whiskers are the lowest datum still within 1.5 times that of the lower
quartile and the highest datum still within 1.5 times that of the upper quartile. The open circles at the end
of the box-plot represent outliers (values 1.5 times less or greater than the interquartile range). RF: Reef
front, or accretionary zone, HG: Coral hard ground or non-accretionary zone; key spp.: key reef building
species; Non-accretional: non-accretional species.
Fidure 3 shows the Ecological Importance Value Index of coral species by geomorphic zones in Punta Maroma
reef before 1990s (based on 1985 data) and in 2019. The index is based on the relative abundance,
frequency and spatial contribution of each species with respect to the coral assemblage. RF: Reef front,
HG: coral hard ground.Species are represented by codex as follow: APAL: Acropora palmata,ACER: A.
cervicornis, APRO: A. prolifera, AAGA: Agaricia agaricites, AFRA: A. fragilis, AHUM: A. humilis,
ALAM: A. lamarcki, ATEN: A. tenuifolia, CNAT: Colpophyllia natans, DSTO: Dichocoenia stokesii,

spp. Complex (Orbicella faveolata, O. annularis), MLAM: Mycetophyllia lamarckiana, PAST: Porites
astreoides, PFUR: P. furcata, PDIV: P. divaricata, PPOR: P. porites, PSTR: Pseudodiploria. strigosa,
SSID: Siderastrea siderea, SRAD: S. radians, SBOU: Solenastrea bournoni, SINT: Stephanocoenia
intercepta. 
Figure 4 is a Comparison of the contemporary and historical abundance for each species at transect level.
Color shaded plots of four root transformed species abundance (rows) by transect (columns) and zone
(reef front vs hard coral ground) for (A) contemporary (2019) and (B) historical (before 1990s) data .(A)
The (linear) colored scale is shown in the key with back-transformed counts where white squares indicate
zero counts or species accounting for 5% or less of the total abundance. x.axis represents the transect
depth of n- samples. y.axis represent species as in codex detailed in captions of Figure 3.
Figure 5 graphically shows Principal Component Analysis (PCO) derived from the Bray–Curtis similarity matrix
constructed using a fourth root transformed matrix of standardized abundances of scleractinian coral
species in two sampling zones at Punta Maroma reef seascape before 1990s and in 2019: a frontal zone of
a fringing reef (RF) and a hard coral ground (HG) zone. Vectors visualize, through Pearson correlation
coefficient, the potential monotonic relationship between the species accounting for 70% of total
abundances and ordination axes a PCO. AAGA: Agaricia agaricites, ATEN: A. tenuifolia, ACER:
Acropora cervicornis, APAL: A. palmata, DSTO: Dichocoenia stokesii, MCAV: Montastraea cavernosa,
MANN CX: M. annularis spp. complex, PAST: Porites astreoides, PSTR: Pseudodiploria strigosa, SSID:
Siderastrea siderea. 
Table 2 shows Coral species and number of colonies recorded in two geomorphic zones at Punta Maroma reef
seascape before 1990s and in 2019. Coral species are classified according to their growth morphology
(Darling et al., 2012). HG: Hard Ground zone, RF: Reef front zone of the fringing reef. Key spp.:
‘reef-building’ species, Non-accretional Spp.: less influential species for accretion processes

Raw data are available  within the foldeer "raw data" in files "CSV ABUNDANCIA ACTUAL MATRIZ" for contemporary surveys, "CSV PUMA LCC SPACE TIME OLD" for historical surveys within the period 1985 and 1989, "CSV Morphometric_data" correspond to size data of coral colonies in 1985 and 2019 (data from from 1979 were not colected)."DenSpp-Mar" and "Historico.79.85_MarSp" datasets are derived from raw csv mentioned above to create graphics in R.
